# Capucin
The principal of the college "The Capuchins in Melun", Mr. Fortin, is the origin of the demand (January / February 2018).

He wants to facilitate access to the list of local businesses that host, or have hosted in the past, third graders.

For this, he asked 2 students of BTS SIO, Angélique Cottencin and Salomé Thomas, as part of their second year SLAM internship, to produce a software-based business solution, web application type.
The current architecture has been designed with symfony, which makes it possible to integrate a strong technical expertise framework.
